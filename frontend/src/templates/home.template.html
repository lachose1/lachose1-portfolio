		Hello, I am Hugo Lalibert√©, creative coder and interactivity consultant. I've been programming since I'm eleven, which means I've started around 2004. As the years went by, I've specialised in web development and started freelancing in 2009. Over the course of years, I've enlarged my skillset to also specialise in creative development by developing multiple interactive applications. I have a passion for programmation as it helps me to channel and express my creativity.

	    	With multiple years of experience in web development, interactive programming and development of electronic systems, I know how to juggle with technologies to make your project work. I've worked for different companies on projects ranging from creative installations to cashless systems running in real-time with thousands of users. I'm usually known as the guy that "makes everything work together".</td>
	    <td>I've been developing professional products for years. The user has always been at the center of my development workflow. How can we create an experience more engaging and captivating for the user? How will he use the system, will it make him more frustrated or happier? Those are some of the questions I can help you answer.</td>
