		Hello, I am Hugo Lalibert√©, creative coder and interactivity consultant. I've been programming since I was eleven, which means I started around 2004. As the years went by, I specialised in web development and started freelancing in 2009. Over the course of years, I increased my skillset by developing multiple interactive applications. I have a passion for programming as it allows me to channel and express my creativity.
